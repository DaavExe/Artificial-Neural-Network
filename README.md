# Artificial-Neural-Network
Artificial Neural Networks &amp; Deep Learning Projects (Politecnico di Milano)



The project involves designing, training, and optimizing neural networks for image classification (using CNNs) and time series forecasting (using RNNs). 
It incorporates advanced techniques such as fine-tuning, data preprocessing, data augmentation, hyperparameter optimization, and regularization to enhance model performance.
